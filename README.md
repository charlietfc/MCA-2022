## Week 1 Write Up

In my experience the challenges of working with music and music related data are situated in the finding of accurate and legitimate notated data. In terms of distribution both too much and too little can be a problem. Too much distribution can inevitably lead to studying or taking data off of a score that is inaccurate. Too little distribution can make it hard to find the data in the first place. This relates to my selected theme, the orchestral work of Debussy, as many different versions of his work exist online. Amongst this there are also various transcriptions and arrangements of his work too. Finding a clear and accurate score amongst the illegitimate ones can be difficult. In addition, as he is a very popular composer there are many different recordings and versions of acoustic data available. Too much choice and too many variations can make it hard to find a precise version. 

Debussy’s work is well documented and recorded. All of his scores are available in the public domain and are on imslp. Many recordings made of his work are on spotify. IMSLP also contains metadata on Debussy’s work.
